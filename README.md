Hello I'm eat-your-glory!
I have a lot of accounts all over social media platforms!
I wanna learn a coding language, but I really don't know which.
If you ever want to contact me, please send me a dm on Twitter/X @falang3_ricky , there I have my dms open for everyone and contacting me on there guarantees a response by me.
